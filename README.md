👋🏼 Hi, I’m Durga Prasad — a Data Architect with 20+ years of experience building enterprise-scale data solutions across cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. My current focus includes Databricks, Power BI along with solution design and technical leadership in data architecture.

Beyond Data & Report design, I specialize in **technology and business content creation**, including user guides, solution documentation, and branding-focused deliverables. I combine my technical expertise with strong design sensibilities — crafting engaging documents using tools like **Adobe InDesign, Canva, and other design platforms** to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively.

My work sits at the intersection of data, design, and human experience — ensuring solutions are not only robust, but also understandable, impactful, and user-centered.

Beyond IT, I’m a lifelong student of Psychology, Vedic Astrology, Ayurveda, and Indian Philosophy — weaving together ancient wisdom and modern data science to understand patterns in both people and systems.

Also an Artist with skills in Painting, Scultpture and Photography with heavy interest in UI/UX.
