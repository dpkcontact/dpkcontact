# 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Durga Prasad

I'm a seasoned **Data Architect** with over 20 years of experience in designing and implementing enterprise-scale data solutions across cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**. My current focus areas include **Databricks**, **Power BI**, and **semantic modeling**, where I specialize in solution design and technical leadership in data architecture.

Beyond data engineering, I have a passion for **technical content creation**. I craft comprehensive user guides, solution documentation, and branding materials that bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and user-friendly communication. Utilizing tools like **Adobe InDesign**, **Canva**, and other design platforms, I ensure that documentation is both informative and visually engaging.

My work lies at the intersection of data, design, and human experience, aiming to deliver solutions that are robust, understandable, impactful, and user-centered.

Outside the realm of IT, I'm a lifelong student of **Psychology**, **Vedic Astrology**, **Ayurveda**, and **Indian Philosophy**. I strive to integrate ancient wisdom with modern data science to uncover patterns in both systems and human behavior.

🎨 In my artistic pursuits, I engage in **painting** and **sculpture**, exploring creativity beyond the digital space.
